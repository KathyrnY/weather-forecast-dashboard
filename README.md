# weather-forecast-dashboard

## Description

Created a weather dashboard to utilize a 3rd party API called [OpenWeather](#https://openweathermap.org/) in order to show current and future condition for a city searched by the user. Next using local storage the information will stay appended to the page even when it's refreshed. This will allow users to view previous cities they inquired on. When you enter your desired city it will popluate the name, current date, icon of the weather conditions, temp, humidity and wind speed along with a five day forecast below it to show future conditions. Below you will find an image of what the site looks like--
